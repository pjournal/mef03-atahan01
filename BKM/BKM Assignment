# Get Data and Prepare for Analysis

We will get our data from https://bkm.com.tr/secilen-aya-ait-sektorel-gelisim/ which is given data table 

#### First step Libraries
```{r}
library(rvest)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyverse)
```

#### Collecting links from website according our date request

We will change month and year sections in link with for loop and create a list.We will collect between 2018-2019(24 month)

```{r}
x <- list()
for (i in 18:19){
  for (j in 1:12) {
    x[[paste0("20",i,".",j)]]<-paste0("https://bkm.com.tr/secilen-aya-ait-sektorel-gelisim/?filter_year=20",i,"&filter_month=",j,"&List=Listele")
  }
}

head(x,n=2)
```

#### Create blank Dataframe for our main work field
```{r}
DF <- data.frame()
```

# Creating Civilized Dataframe

In this part we will download our data link by link read it with rvest clean and bind into DF.

That chunk will give warning about LHS because our data frame contain NA's



```{r}
for (i in seq_along(x)){
  html_monthly <- read_html(x[[i]])
  temp_df <- html_table(html_monthly,fill=T)[[4]]
  temp_df <- temp_df[-c(1,2,28,29),]
  temp_df$date <- names(x)[i]
  DF <- bind_rows(DF,temp_df)
}

```

#### Remove NA's from our dataframes
We don't have data after 2019.06 let's remove NA's
```{r}
DF <- DF[complete.cases(DF),]
```

#### Date formatting
Our date column structure is chr we have to convert the date format for arranging
```{r}
DF$date <- ymd(DF$date,truncated = 1)
```

#### Column names setup
```{r}
colnames(DF) <- c("segment","n_cc","n_dc","sum_cc","sum_dc","date")

print(head(DF))
```

#### Character format and punctuation arrangement
In our dataframe current amounts format is chars and seperated with commas.We will change commas and formats for use in analysis

```{r}
DF$sum_cc <- gsub("[,]","",DF$sum_cc)
DF$sum_dc <- gsub("[,]","",DF$sum_dc)

DF$sum_cc <- as.numeric(as.character(DF$sum_cc))
DF$sum_dc <- as.numeric(as.character(DF$sum_dc))

print(head(DF))
```


# Some Analysis and Plots
First analysis i want to see the effect of dollar event in July 2018 on rent-a car services combined credit card and debit card

```{r}
rent_car_analysis <- DF %>%
  arrange(date) %>% 
  filter(segment %in% "ARABA KİRALAMA")%>%
  mutate(TOTAL = rowSums(.[4:5]))%>%
  select(segment,date,TOTAL)


rent_car_analysis
```
Let's look in line graph

```{r}
ggplot(rent_car_analysis,aes(x=date,y=TOTAL))+
  geom_line()
```

It seems a sharp fall after July 2018

Let's look air ticket spending

```{r}
air_ticket_analysis <- DF %>%
  arrange(date) %>% 
  filter(segment %in% "HAVAYOLLARI")%>%
  mutate(TOTAL = rowSums(.[4:5]))%>%
  select(segment,date,TOTAL)

ggplot(air_ticket_analysis,aes(x=date,y=TOTAL))+
  geom_line()
```


It doesn't look like there is a significant change on air tickets
